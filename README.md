# StudyMate

A simple web-based flashcard app. Users can create stacks of flashcards, add cards to stacks, and view them. Data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so no backend is required. Works on desktop and mobile browsers including Android and iOS.

Recent updates introduce a lightweight quiz mode with spaced repetition style notifications. Decks can be marked as **Active** for study scheduling and the notification interval is user configurable via the Settings dialog.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Create stacks, add cards, and start studying!
