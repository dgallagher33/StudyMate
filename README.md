# StudyMate

A simple flashcard web app built with **React**. Users can create stacks of cards, add new cards, and study them. All data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so no backend is required. Works on desktop and mobile browsers including Android and iOS.

Recent updates introduce a lightweight quiz mode with spaced repetition style notifications. Decks can be marked as **Active** for study scheduling and the notification interval is user configurable via a dedicated Settings screen.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Create stacks, add cards, and start studying!
